Follow instructions on https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

*But, worth noting:
There is no current Tensorflow library for Python 3.6.X (most likely installed on your Anaconda Installation).
Hence, follow this instructions:

1 Launch your Anaconda CMD as Admin
#if tensorflow virtual env has been created, remove it first
	1a conda remove --name tensorflow --all
2 conda create -n tensorflow  --python=3.5 anaconda
3 activate tensorflow
4 conda install spyder
5 conda install ipython
6 pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
7 run spyder from console
